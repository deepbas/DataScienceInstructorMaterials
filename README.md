# Introduction to Data Science - Carleton College, Spring '24

Welcome to the repository for the lecture materials from the "Introduction to Data Science" course I taught at Carleton College, MN during the Spring of 2024. This course was designed to equip students with foundational skills and knowledge in data science, focusing on practical applications and theoretical underpinnings.

## Course Structure

The course was structured around a series of lectures, practical lab sessions, and assignments that introduced students to various aspects of data science. Topics covered included data manipulation, statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization.

## R Ecosystem and Quarto

All lectures and materials were developed within the R ecosystem, utilizing the state-of-the-art Quarto platform to create dynamic, reproducible lecture notes and assignments. Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc, which allows seamless integration of R code into high-quality documents. This approach ensured that all demonstrations and analyses were interactive and easily accessible, providing students with hands-on experience using real-world datasets.
