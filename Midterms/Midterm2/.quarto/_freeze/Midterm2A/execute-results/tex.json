Considering the need to control computational load in a data-intensive Shiny application, what is the best use of `actionButton` in conjunction with reactive expressions?\n\n\nA) Use `actionButton` to reset user inputs to their default states without affecting any reactive expressions or outputs.\nB) Implement `actionButton` as a method to bypass reactivity and directly manipulate output displays without data reprocessing.\nC) To trigger data processing only after all user inputs have been finalized, using `actionButton` to activate `eventReactive()` computations.\nD) `actionButton` should only be used to trigger UI updates, such as showing or hiding elements, not for controlling reactive data processes.\nE) Combine `actionButton` with `isolate()` to ensure that reactive expressions are updated without user intervention.\n\n\n### (b). Which statement best describes the roles and differences between `eventReactive`, `observe`, and `renderPlot` in managing the app's reactivity and user interactions?\n\n\nA) `renderPlot` is an observer that automatically updates the plot whenever the `filtered_data()` reactive expression changes, regardless of any user interaction.\n\nB) The `actionButton` is ineffective without an observe function because eventReactive does not properly capture button clicks.\n\nC) Using `eventReactive` rather than observe with `actionButton` unnecessarily complicates the app since both serve the same purpose of updating outputs based on input changes.\n\nD) `renderPlot` should be used with observe instead of `eventReactive` to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of the plot updates.\n\nE) `eventReactive` is used to update the data when the 'Update Chart' button is clicked, ensuring data processing is limited to this action, whereas observe would continuously monitor changes in inputs without requiring an action button.\n\n\n### (c). In the Shiny application provided, how would you modify the app to use `observeEvent()` for a specific scenario where you only want to update the data and re-render the plot when both the year and gender have been changed by the user?\n\nA) Incorporate `observeEvent(list(input$year, input$gender), {...})` to ensure joint reactivity without using `actionButton.`\nB) Replace `eventReactive(input$update, ...)` with `observeEvent(c(input$year, input$gender), {...})` to trigger updates only when both inputs are altered.\nC) Use `observeEvent(input$year & input$gender, {...})` to monitor changes in both inputs simultaneously.\nD) Maintain `eventReactive` and add `observeEvent(input$update, {...})` to separately handle other UI updates.\nE) `observeEvent()` cannot be used with multiple inputs and should only be used with single input actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Q3 (10 points each)\n\nThis HTML code is part of a webpage containing product information, including prices and descriptions.\n\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>Product Page</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\"products\">\n        <h1>Our Products</h1>\n        <div class=\"product-item\" data-id=\"1\">\n            <span class=\"product-name\">Gadget</span>\n            <span class=\"product-price\">$19.99</span>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"product-item\" data-id=\"2\">\n            <span class=\"product-name\">Widget</span>\n            <span class=\"product-price\">$25.99</span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n### (a).

A confusion matrix shows the classification performance:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\\begin{longtable}[t]{lrr}\n\\toprule\n\\cellcolor[HTML]{6C757D}{\\textcolor{white}{\\textbf{}}} & \\cellcolor[HTML]{6C757D}{\\textcolor{white}{\\textbf{Predicted Negative}}} & \\cellcolor[HTML]{6C757D}{\\textcolor{white}{\\textbf{Predicted Positive}}}\\\\\n\\midrule\nActual Negative & 55 & 15\\\\\nActual Positive & 19 & 91\\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### (a). What is the accuracy of the model according to the provided confusion matrix?\n\nA) 0.755\nB) 0.811\nC) 0.852\nD) 0.903\nE) 0.954\n\n\n### (b). In the context of k-NN, how does the use of Euclidean distance affect the classification in high-dimensional spaces?\n\nA) Euclidean distance calculations become computationally cheaper as more dimensions are added.\nB) Euclidean distance becomes more meaningful as the number of dimensions increases, improving classification accuracy.\nC) The distance metric tends to not differentiate well between the nearest and farthest neighbors as dimensionality increases (curse of dimensionality).\nD) Increasing dimensionality reduces the overall distance between points, leading to less meaningful neighbor calculations.\nE) None of the above; Euclidean distance is independent of the dimensionality of the space.\n\n\n\n### (c). When tuning k for a k-NN model, how can ROC curves be utilized to select an optimal k value?\n\nA) The ROC curve should be used to select a k that maximizes both sensitivity and specificity simultaneously.\nB) Choose k that maximizes the area under the ROC curve, balancing sensitivity and (1 - specificity).\nC) Select k that minimizes the area under the ROC curve to ensure maximum model complexity.\nD) Use the ROC curve to find a k where the true positive rate equals the false positive rate.\nE) ROC curves are irrelevant in the context of tuning k in k-NN models.\n\n\n\n### (d). How is class assignment determined in k-NN?\n\nA) The class is determined by a weighted vote based on the distance of the k nearest neighbors.\nB) The class with the most representatives among the nearest neighbors determines the class of the query point.\nC) The class is assigned based on the average distance to all points within the k nearest neighbors.\nD) The class is assigned randomly among the classes of the k nearest neighbors.\nE) The class of the nearest single neighbor is always chosen, regardless of k.\n\n\n\n### (e). Which of the following best describes the relationship between sensitivity, specificity, and the choice of k in k-NN?\n\nA) Both sensitivity and specificity are maximized at an intermediate value of k, which perfectly balances the local and global data structures.\nB) A smaller k typically increases sensitivity by capturing finer details, but may decrease specificity due to overfitting to noise.\nC) A larger k enhances specificity at the cost of decreasing sensitivity, as the model generalizes by considering more neighbors.\nD) Sensitivity and specificity are independent of k; they are more influenced by the dataset's intrinsic characteristics.\nE) A larger k always increases both sensitivity and specificity by utilizing more data for decision-making.\n\n\n\n### (f). How does averaging the results from k-fold cross-validation affect the selection of k in k-NN?\n\nA) It identifies a k that performs consistently well across different subsets of the data, enhancing generalization.\nB) The method biases the selection towards k values that overfit the training data, as averaged results mask the variance.\nC) Cross-validation tends to select smaller values of k, as they usually yield higher accuracy on smaller test sets.\nD) Averaging results tends to favor larger k values, as variability in the validation results is minimized.\nE) Cross-validation is not useful in k-NN because the algorithm is non-parametric and does not generalize beyond its training set.\n\n\n## Q5 (5 points each)\n\nConsider a logistic regression model used for a binary classification problem that predicts whether a student will pass (1) or fail (0) an exam. The model uses one predictor: the student's hours of study per week. The logistic regression equation is given by:\n\n$$\\log \\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)=-3+0.5 \\times \\text { Hours of Study }$$\n\nwhere $p$ is the probability that the student passes the exam.\n\n\n### (a).

If a student needs to achieve at least an 80% chance of passing the exam, how many total hours must they study per week? Use the logistic equation to find the minimum required study hours. You may find the following useful:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlog(4)\n## [1] 1.386294\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nA) 5 hours\nB) 7 hours\nC) 8 hours\nD) 9 hours\nE) More than 14 hours\n\n\n\n### (c). The coefficient of hours of study in the logistic regression model is 0.5. What is the interpretation of this coefficient?\n\nA) The odds of passing increase by a factor of `exp(0.5)` for each additional hour of study.\nB) The probability of passing increases by 50% for each additional hour of study.\nC) The probability of passing increases as study hours increase.\nD) The odds of passing are doubled for each additional hour of study.\nE) The odds of passing increase by 50% for each additional hour of study.\n\n### (d). In logistic regression, if the outcome variable represents \"pass\" (1) or \"fail\" (0) in an exam, and a significant predictor has a negative coefficient, what does this imply about the relationship between the predictor and the likelihood of passing?\n\nA) As study hours increase, the likelihood of passing the exam increases.\nB) There is no relationship between study hours and the likelihood of passing.\nC) The predictor inversely predicts the likelihood of passing but does not affect the odds.\nD) As study hours increase, the likelihood of passing the exam decreases.\nE) The effect of study hours on the likelihood of passing is ambiguous and requires further testing.\n",
