## What is data science?

::: bqt
:::: font90
Data science is the application of **computational** and **statistical** techniques to gain insight into some problem in the real world

## Active Participation and Experimentation

::: bq
::: incremental

- **Engage Actively** with provided `.Rmd` documents during class
  - Use these for note-taking and running code live.

- **Ask Questions**
  - Every question is valuable; we're learning together.

- **Experiment**
  - Trial and error is key; explore and experiment with the code.

## R Vs Python for data science

::: green-h
::: font60
"R is written by statisticians, for statisticians,"
<span style="float: right;">— Norm Matloff, Author of The Art of R Programming, Prof. of Computer Science, UC Davis</span>
:::

<br>

::: bqt
::: font80
::: incremental
Advantages of R over Python:

-   Not so steep learning curve as Python
-   R has many generic functions that are universal, e.g. `print()`, `plot()`, `summary()`
-   R Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) has many user-friendly packages
-   R's basic `help()` and `example()` functions are much more informative than Python's counterparts

### Using R Markdown for Data Science

::: lqt
::: font60

- In this class, we will use R Markdown for all our work, leveraging its comprehensive support for data science projects.
- A R Markdown document (`.Rmd`) integrates:
  - R code for dynamic analysis and visualization.
  - Descriptive text 
- Compiling (rendering) a `.Rmd` file produces various output formats
  - Documents: PDF, HTML, Word.
  - Presentations: HTML-based slides, PDF slides via Beamer.
  - Interactive content: Web dashboards, interactive visualizations.
- R Markdown is engineered with reproducibility as a core principle, facilitating transparent and repeatable research workflows.
- The presentations for this class is made using Quarto Markdown

## Version Control using Git and GitHub

::: row
::: left
::: font60 
::: bqt
- *User:* A Github account for you (e.g., deepbas). 
- *Organization:* The Github account for one or more user (e.g., DataScienceSpring24). 
- *Repository:* A folder within the organization that includes files dedicated to a project. 
- *Local Github:* Copies of Github files located your computer. 
- *Remote Github:* Github files located on the https://github.com website. 
- *Clone:* Process of making a local copy of a remote Github repository. 
- *Pull:* Copy changes on the remote Github repository to your local Github repository. 
- *Push:* Save local changes to remote Github

### Using GitHub and Posit for data science

::: bq

- **Integrate R Markdown with GitHub** for version control:
  - Create a GitHub repository.
  - Clone the repo and set up a R Markdown project in RStudio.
  - Work with various files (`.Rmd`, `.r`, `.csv`, etc.).
  - Commit changes locally and push to GitHub.
  - Pull updates from others into your local workspace.
:::

::: hljs
R Markdown enhances the workflow by seamlessly integrating executable code with narrative text, making your data science projects reproducible and collaborative.
