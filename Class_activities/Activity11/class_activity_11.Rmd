## Problem 1

Let's learn about combining strings with different separators first.

```{r}
place <- "Central Park"
activity <- "jogging"
activities <- c("jogging", "picnicking", "boating")
my_sentence <- str_c(place, " is great for ", activity, ".", sep = "")
```


a. What happens when a `str_c` entry is a vector?

*Answer:* 

```{r}
my_sentences <- str_c(place, " is great for ", activities, ".", sep = "")
```


b. How do you combine strings with `str_glue`?

*Answer:* 


```{r}

```


c. What does `str_flatten` do?

*Answer:* 


```{r}

```


d. What will using a `\n` separator do in the command below?

*Answer:* 


```{r}

```


e. Does `str_length` count spaces and special characters??

*Answer:* 


```{r}

```


f. How do you count the number of `e`'s in a string?

*Answer:* 

```{r}
text <- "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
pattern <- "e"
vowel_count <- 
```



g. What happens with negative positions?

*Answer:* 


```{r}


```


h. How do you extract a `substring` with positive and negative positions?

*Answer:* 


```{r}
my_sentence <- "Central Park is great for jogging."

```


i. With a vector of positions?

*Answer:* 


```{r}

```


j. How do you extract multiple `substrings` using a vector of positions?

*Answer:* 


```{r}


```

## Problem 2

a. Use the string parsing functions that you learned today to do tasks described in the comments below: 

```{r}
s1 <- "12%"  # remove %
s2 <- "New Jersey_*"  # remove _*
s3 <- "2,150"    # remove comma(,)
s4 <- "Learning #datascience is fun!"   # extract #datascience
s5 <- "123 Main St, Springfield, MA, 01101"   # separate info

# Cleaning steps
s1_clean <- 
s2_clean <- 
s3_clean <- 
s4_clean <- 
s5_clean <- 

# Print cleaned strings
s1_clean
s2_clean
s3_clean
s4_clean
s5_clean
```



## Problem 3

a. Let's look at the following dataset containing information about movies and their release years. We'll extract the release year from the movie title, create a new column with decades, and count the number of movies in each decade.


```{r}
# Sample dataset
movies <- tibble(
  title = c(
    "The Godfather (1972)", "Pulp Fiction (1994)", "The Dark Knight (2008)",
    "Forrest Gump (1994)", "The Shawshank Redemption (1994)", "The Matrix (1999)",
    "Inception (2010)", "Interstellar (2014)", "Parasite (2019)", "Fight Club (1999)"
  )
)
movies
```


```{r}
# Processing the dataset
movies_processed <- movies %>%
  mutate(
    release_year = ),
    decade = 
  ) %>%
  count() 

# Print the processed dataset
movies_processed
```
