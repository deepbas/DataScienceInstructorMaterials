## Problem 1

a)  Use `read_csv()` to import the `desserts` data set from [GitHub url](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepbas/statdatasets/main/desserts.csv). Use `glimpse` to see if the data import is alright.

```{r}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepbas/statdatasets/main/desserts.csv"
desserts <- read_csv(url)
glimpse(desserts)
```

Does everything look good? Import the dataset with correct data types, if needed. Fix the problems, if any.

```{r}
# your r-code

```

## Problem 2

a)  Use the appropriate `read_<type>()` function to import the datasets provided in the [course webpage](https://stat220-spring24.netlify.app/datasets). Identify and fix any issues you encounter.

If you hit any errors/problems, be sure to explore them and identify the issue, even if you can't "fix" it.

```{r}
# your code for simple 1

```

```{r}
# your code for mild 1

```

```{r}
# your code for tricky 1

```

The issue is that we have missing values that aren't specifically included in the rows 4 and 7 of the **original** file (so rows 3 and 6 once we load the data). We can fix this with post processing

```{r}
# your post-processing code

```

```{r}
# your code for tricky 2


```

Why are there state abbreviations in the latitude column?

```{r}
# your post-processing code


```
